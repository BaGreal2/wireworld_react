# WireWorld - a cellular network!

This is a variation of a famous cellular automata - wireworld with some kind of network in it.

## Tech stackðŸ’»

This app is build on JavaScript with React, Redux and some another small libraries.
Authorization is done via NodeJS on back-end.

## How to runðŸš€

I used regular npx create-react-app, so to install all dependencies you need to run:

```zsh
npm install
```

After installation is complete you only need to run:

```zsh
npm start
```

## How to useðŸ’­

App consists of 7 pages:
- Registration page
- Login page
- Home page
- Schema post page
- Schemas list page
- User schema page
- About page

You can visit home and about pages without registration, but to see other user's schemas you have to login/register.
The home page is a main page of an app, here you can fully build your WireWorld schema and deploy it!
